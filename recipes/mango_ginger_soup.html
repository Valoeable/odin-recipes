    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This deliciously sweet and spicy mango soup makes a refreshing first course to a vegan or vegetarian affair,<br> but can also be a side dish to heartier vegan dishes or an innovative dessert whenever you're looking to wow your guests.<br></p>  
    <p>Fresh mangoes, lime juice, chili peppers, ginger, and onions make a tasty and unexpected combination that is beautifully colorful,<br> easy to prepare, and can become a new favorite go-to for busy weeknights or a brunch buffet.<br>
        Best yet, because it keeps well in the fridge, you can make it ahead of time and use it when needed.</p>
